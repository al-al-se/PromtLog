# PromtLog
PromtLog is a library for simple and fast logging, fast to codding and fast to running yours applications. 
It is just my home project.

I would make fast, crossplatform library.

Include PromtLog.h file.

Base usage:
```
 promt_log::info()<<"I use PromtLog";
```
Use logger_locator.h for read logger config from json and get loggers by name or id. I want make this like NLog.config.

* file logger
* udp logger
